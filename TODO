ROADMAP
=======

0.X:
    - required fields on forms,
    - avoid to run several times the same thread/function
      while it is already running.
    - give up forms as pop-up, look at the possibility to draw them
      over the workarea (form panel to display/hide),
    - improve form components (field widgets),
    - browse data,
    - open a terminal with a Python session and OERP class instanciated,

0.1:
    - handle error message,
    - tooltip/label on forms helping the user (current forms will be replaced
      in a next version),
    - be able to scroll on a graph (up/down, left/right with shift key),
